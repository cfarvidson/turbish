# TURBISH is taking a time out...

*February 19, 2017*

I'm putting the **TURBISH**  project on hold for a while.

About two years ago I started to create an uptime monitoring service that I would use. Free of charge and awesome. I also did this as a fun way to get into the world of web programming.

For the past couple of months I have been rebuilding **TURBISH** with a 100% RESTful API back-end and a React front-end.

The back-end is completed but the new front-end is not finished.

I recently started a new job and I feel that (for the moment) I don't have enough free time to keep building on the application and maintaining the servers.

Check back in a couple of months.. Or email me at **cfp-at-highball.se** if you have any questions.
