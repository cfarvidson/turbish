# TURBISH is taking a time out...

*February 19, 2017*

I'm putting the turbish project on hold for a while.

For the past couple of months I have been rebuilding **TURBISH** with a 100% RESTful API backend and a React front-end. The backend is completed but the new GUI is not finished.

I recently started a new job and I feel that, for the moment, I don't have the time to keep building **TURBISH** and keeping the servers running for the time being. (It's been a 100% free service funded by me.) 

Check back in a couple of months.. Or email me at *cfp-at-highball.se* if you have any questions.
